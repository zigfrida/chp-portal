## Project Website

### Getting started
Blah blah blah

### Did you know..
Blah blah blah

As of right now, there are protected client & admin routes. 
Each client can only see their own portfolio, but each admin can see all the portfolios.

### TODOs

#### passwords should expire
  > after some time (in months), a user's password should expire
        > bold suggestion: a year
  
#### clients should be booted out after a certain amount of time
  > after 10 minutes of inactivity, the user should be logged out
  
#### fix templating layouts
  > it is really ugly right now and growing bigger, it will be a mess.
  
#### figure out how admins can edit a client's portfolio
  > once this is achieved, another milestone (albeit small) will be achieved
    this is one of the core functionalities the website should provide
    
#### modify the implemented login + email system with the website to be more fluent
  > it sucks having to login & logout through /home
  > it sucks when you reset your password (on user create)
    just doesn't feel well
    
#### throw it up on the server
  > this is gonna suck so it has been delayed, but it's pretty important
  
#### logout a user after a certain amount of time
  > simlar to how banks do it, a client would likely be 'active' on the site for a maximum of ten minutes,
    so log them out after that period of time so another person doesn't see their information on their laptop
  
#### set up investor statement on the website               Working on it: Amanda
  > create the statement that is sent to the users on a web page
  
#### set up database                                        Working on it: Amanda
  > figure out the dependencies, the tables that will have to be created and primary keys.
  
  
  
  
  
#### on user create, give a signal to the admin             Complete
  > use sweet alert 2 to make a modal or something so that there is visual feedback when a user is succesfully created

test
